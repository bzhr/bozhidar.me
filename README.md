## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |

## 📬 Newsletter Subscription (Listmonk)

This site includes a newsletter subscribe form rendered on all pages and a Netlify Function that subscribes users to your Listmonk instance.

- Component: `src/components/SubscribeForm.astro`
- Function: `netlify/functions/subscribe.js`

Configure these environment variables in your Netlify site settings:

- `LISTMONK_URL` — e.g. `https://listmonk.bozhidar.me`
- `LISTMONK_USERNAME` — Listmonk admin/API username
- `LISTMONK_PASSWORD` — Listmonk admin/API password
- `LISTMONK_LIST_ID` — Numeric ID of the target Listmonk list (e.g., 2).

Notes:
- The function posts to `POST /api/subscribers?upsert=true` with Basic Auth.
- A simple honeypot field (`company`) is used to deter bots.
- For a nicer UX, the form progressively enhances submission via `fetch`, but also works as a normal HTML form.
